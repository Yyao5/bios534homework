A casino has two types of dices. A fair one with equal probability for all faces, a loaded one with 0.8 probability to show one dot, and equal probability for all other outcomes. In each game, a dice is tossed ten times. It is known that the fair dice is twice as likely to be used as the loaded one.

(1) Before the game, Sam chose the payout plan A in which a correct answer of fair dice will award him $100, a correct answer of loaded dice will award him $50, incorrect answer received $0. After the game, he was told the number of times number 6 appeared, and nothing else. What is player A’s best strategy based on Bayesian decision theory?

(2) Before the game, Kim chose the payout plan B in which a correct answer of fair dice will award $50, a correct answer of loaded dice will award $100, incorrect answer received $0. After the game, Kim was told the number of times number 5 appeared, and nothing else. What is Kimm’s best strategy based on Bayesian decision theory?
